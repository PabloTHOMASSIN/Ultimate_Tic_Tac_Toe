ESILV A3 Data science project : "Ultimate Tic Tac Toe AI"

## Introduction
Hello everyone,

I'm delighted to introduce our Data Science project for the A3 semester at ESILV: "Ultimate Tic Tac Toe AI". This exciting project explores the capabilities of artificial intelligence in the realm of games, specifically in the game of Tic Tac Toe, but with an ultimate and intricate twist.

In this GitHub repository, we've gathered all the essential elements of our work: from source code to documentation to utilized resources. Our aim is to create an AI capable of playing Tic Tac Toe on a board composed of nine sub-grids, each square of which is another game of Tic Tac Toe.

This project provides us with a fantastic opportunity to explore various machine learning techniques, algorithm design, and advanced programming. We look forward to sharing our progress with you and engaging in discussions to further enhance our AI.

Feel free to explore our GitHub repository and share your feedback, suggestions, or questions. Your contribution is invaluable in helping us push this project to new heights in the field of AI applied to games.

Welcome to the world of "Ultimate Tic Tac Toe AI"!

Best regards,
